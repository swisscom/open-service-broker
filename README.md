## Introduction

Open Service Broker is an implementation of the [Open Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.11/spec.md). It enables platforms such as [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) & [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to provision and manage services.

Open Service Broker is built in a modular way and one service broker can host multiple services.

Service broker offers extra functionality regarding Billing, Backup/Restore on top of the Open Service Broker API.

Services can be provisioned synchronously and/or asynchronously and the goal of this project is to provide a framework with which any service can easily be provisioned.

The following flow chart shows interactions for service provisioning and service binding for MongoDB Enterprise service.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Java 1.8
- MySQL / MariaDB Server


## Deployment
### Build

Build Service Broker using the `gradlew` script in the root directory of the repository.

```bash
$ ./gradlew clean build -x test -x integrationTest -x functionalTest -Ptomcat
```

The parameter called _tomcat_ is for controlling if a tomcat runtime is integrated into the war.

Command below gives you a self executable jar 
```bash
$ ./gradlew clean build -x test -x integrationTest -x functionalTest 
```


### Database

To run the service broker locally a mariadb or mysql database with name _CFbroker_ is required.
The database tables will be generated automatically by the application. See the configuration section for more details.

#### Use Docker for MariaDB setup
```bash
docker run --name appc-cf-service-broker-db -e MYSQL_DATABASE=CFBroker -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes -p 3306:3306 -d mariadb
```

### Run

To run the built artifact, from the root directory the following commands can be executed:
```bash
java -jar -Dspring.config.location=file:/some/path/servicebroker.yml broker/build/libs/service-broker-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.war 
```
The config file passed can overwrite any default values. Providing an external config file is optional and when no external config file is provided, the default values are dictated by application.yml file(s).

or

```bash
./gradlew broker:bootRun
```

At the time being, Service Broker is recommended to run with only one instance to avoid concurrency issues.
This issue will be fixed soon.

### IDE/IntelliJ
When importing this project into IntelliJ, select the "create separate module per source set option".

### Cloud Foundry interactions

Follow the [documentation](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html) to register the broker
to Cloud Foundry.

Before a `cf create-service-broker` or `update-service-broker` call is made, please make sure that Service Broker is configured correctly.
For configuring the catalog, see the service definition section.

### JAVA_OPTS
```bash
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=1024m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC"
```

## Configuration

The configuration file for the Service Broker is located under

[`broker/src/main/resources/application.yml`](broker/src/main/resources/application.yml)

## Service Definitions

Service definitions are maintained in the application.yml under the serviceDefinitions key. This key expects a list of service definitions as values. 
On startup, the service broker will validate that service definitions from in the database exist in the application.yml configurations based on GUID.
Setting the value of serviceDefinitions to an empty list ([]), will bypass the verification.

### Example Service Definition

```yaml
serviceDefinitions:
- guid: 'udn9276f-hod4-5432-vw34-6c33d7359c12'
  name: 'mongodbent'
  description: 'MongoDB Enterprise HA v3.2.11'
  bindable: true
  asyncRequired: true
  internalName: 'mongoDbEnterprise'
  displayIndex: 1
  tags: []
  metadata:
    version: '3.2.11'
    displayName: 'MongoDB Enterprise'
  plans:
  - guid: 'jfkos87r-truz-4567-liop-dfrwscvbnmk6'
    name: 'replicaset'
    description: 'Replica Set with 3 data bearing nodes with 32 GB memory, 320 GB storage, unlimited concurrent connections'
    templateId: 'mongodbent-bosh-template'
    free: false
    displayIndex: 0
    containerParams:
    - template: ''
      name: 'plan'
      value: 'mongoent.small'
    - template: ''
      name: 'vm_instance_type'
      value: 'mongoent.small'
    metadata:
      storageCapacity: '320GB'
      memory: '32GB'
      nodes: '3'
      maximumConcurrentConnections: 'unlimited'
      dedicatedService: true
      highAvailability: true
      displayName: 'Small'
```

**_Following endpoints to be deprecated_**
### Get service definition

Via the example call below, service definitions for a given service id can be retrieved.

```bash
curl -u 'username:password' -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/custom/admin/service-definition/{service_id}'
```

### Add service definition

Service Broker provides a way to update service definitions via HTTP calls.

Here is an example:

```bash
curl -u 'username:password' -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary '@path/to/definition/file' 'http://localhost:8080/custom/admin/service-definition'
```

This interface can be used for both adding a new service or updating an existing one. For an existing service, if a plan that is in use is tried to be removed an exception will be thrown.

### Remove service definition

A service and its plan(s), which are not used i.e. which have no service instances, can be removed via a REST interface.
Here is an example for how to delete a service that has the id `service_id`:

```bash
curl -u 'username:password' -X DELETE 'http://localhost:8080/custom/admin/service-definition/{service_id}'
```

## Brokered Services
### Bosh based services
Any bosh based service can be easily brokered. See [here](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Abosh-release+org%3Aswisscom&type=Repositories) for Swisscom's bosh releases.  
Check the class [`BoshBasedServiceProvider`](broker/src/main/groovy/com/swisscom/cloud/sb/broker/services/bosh/BoshBasedServiceProvider.groovy) for details.

#### MongoDB Enterprise
https://github.com/swisscom/mongodb-enterprise-boshrelease

### Kubernetes based services
Any [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) based service can be provisioned with Open Service Broker. The asynchronous task is being created to prepare the provisioning of the service instance. Kubernetes [Facade](https://github.com/swisscom/open-service-broker/blob/develop/broker/src/main/groovy/com/swisscom/cloud/sb/broker/services/kubernetes/facade/KubernetesFacade.groovy) is using the [client](https://github.com/swisscom/open-service-broker/blob/develop/broker/src/main/groovy/com/swisscom/cloud/sb/broker/services/kubernetes/client/rest/KubernetesClient.groovy) to execute a bunch of "templated" HTTP calls on Kubernetes API. All the templates can be read from the `application.yml` and are automatically read inside a specific [ServiceProvider](https://github.com/swisscom/open-service-broker/blob/develop/broker/src/main/groovy/com/swisscom/cloud/sb/broker/services/kubernetes/facade/redis/service/KubernetesRedisServiceProvider.groovy).
     
### OpenWhisk
Open Service Broker can broker your local deployment of OpenWhisk.

Provision will create a new namespace.

An example of the provision json data (Parameters are optional).
```text
cf create-service openwhisk basic my_open_whisk
 
cf create-service openwhisk basic my_open_whisk -c '{"namespace":"NAMESPACE"}'
```
```json
{
    "service_id": "udn9276f-hod4-5432-vw34-6c33d7359c20",
    "plan_id": "jfkos87r-truz-4567-liop-dfrwscvbnm20",
    "parameters": {
        "namespace": "NAMESPACE"
    }
}
```

Binding will create a new subject within the namespace.

An example of the bind json data (Parameters are optional).
```text
cf bind-service my_app my_open_whisk
 
cf bind-service my_app my_open_whisk -c '{"subject":"SUBJECT"}'
```
```json
{
    "service_id": "udn9276f-hod4-5432-vw34-6c33d7359c20",
    "plan_id": "jfkos87r-truz-4567-liop-dfrwscvbnm20",
    "parameters": {
        "subject": "SUBJECT"
    }
}
```

Binding will return the HOST, UUID, and KEY. With these credentials, you can configure your local OpenWhisk CLI.
```text
wsk property set --apihost HOST --auth UUID:KEY
```

As the OpenWhisk API does not provide the create/update/delete functionality that we were hoping for, we perform CRUD namespace/subject directly into the CouchDB.

### Eden

[Eden](https://github.com/starkandwayne/eden) is a CLI to interact with any Open Service Broker API. 
All operations of the API are supported: discover/provision/bind/unbind/deprovision. 
After [install of Eden](https://github.com/starkandwayne/eden#installation) you can use this commands to play with your broker:
```
export EDEN_BROKER_URL=http://localhost:8080 && export EDEN_BROKER_CLIENT=cc_admin EDEN_BROKER_CLIENT_SECRET=change_me
eden catalog
eden provision -s redis -p small -i test_redis
```
Before you are able to run these commands above make sure to have Open Service Broker running and desired service definitions got published.
